# ChromeExtensionCookieStealer

This is a modified Google Chrome Extension to steal cookies from browser. 
This Extention runs in the background when Chrome opens even without Clicking the Extension. 
And send all cookies to server by fetch method. I included a simple python server to receive cookies.
